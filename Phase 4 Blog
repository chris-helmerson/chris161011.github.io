## Chris Helmerson's Blog Phase 4

For our 4th and final blog post, we were tasked to read a scholarly DS publicationand creating a blog post that explains it to a nontechnical stakeholder. Seeing as its getting late and my brain power is waning, I chose something I was already decently familiar with and that is Decision Trees. Specifically, a paper called "Induction of Decision Trees" by JR Quinlan. As a favor to Diane, Jelly and myself I will keep an emphasis on brevity.


## What are Decision Trees and Why Should You Care?

Decision Trees are a essential tool in a Data Scientist's tool box and are particularly useful with machine learning, which helps save time and in turn saves money. In essence, as a stakeholder, Decision Trees make you more money.

Not enough detail you say...? Well, Decision trees help identify which factors are most important to your bottom line as an investor which helps you make better business decisions.

## How do they work?

A Decision Tree is a tree like model of decisions, outcomes and are weighted by the chance of those outcomes. While the list of industries Decision Trees can be utilized for is far too long for a blog post, a few that the article brings up are...

* Medical diagnosises.
* Determining the winner or loser of a game.
* Predicting weather patterns.

I think its safe to say that Decision Trees can play a major role in our lives without us ever being aware.

## Moving Forward

The article speaks about areas that there are room for improvement in. One of the areas it listed was the development of tools to deal with noisy and incomplete data sets. It was about this moment that I realized that this was published in 1986 as we certainly have these tools now with ScikitLearn. They other area that is suggested is utilizing multiple decision trees, which again, I can't help, but think that that particular problem has been allieviated as well via random forrests and gridsearchs. Well at least JR was on the right track about the future!

Thanks for your time and have a great day,

Chris Helmerson
