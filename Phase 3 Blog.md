##  Capstone Project Exploration

For this blog post, I have decided to analyze my current top three Capstone ideas. I will be going over my potential ideas, limitations and hopefully choose a frontrunner for my capstone project

## 1) Hot Hand Fallacy (Sports/NBA)

Hot Hand Fallacy is the thought that prior results can affect future results. For instance, if I flipped a coin 10 times and a person correctly guessed the result each time, the fallacy would indicate that the person who guessed correctly 10 times would have a higher chance of guessing the next flip correctly than say a random person. This has been proven wrong time and time again with mathematical probabilities, but I want to see if physiological factors such as confidence, having an "Off Night" or being "In the Zone" play a significant role in changing a basketball player’s shooting percentage versus their average shooting percentage. I could also see if the opposite is true and explore the idea of a "Cold Hand". My initial thoughts on how I could conduct this experiment, would be to look at the first 5 shots a player takes in a game. If they made 0-1 shots out of 5 (0-20%) I would classify as the player as "Cold", if the player made 2-3 shots, I would label them as "Normal" and if they player made 4-5 shots, I would classify them as "Hot". I would then compare the remaining shots the player took that night (all shots after 5) and compare that shooting percentage to the players average shooting percentage and look for any significant differences.

The limitation I am running into for this idea isn't that finding game data is particularly hard. The hard part thus far has been finding the data that contains the order the shots were taken and if those shots were successful or not. I will need to continue to look for resources and see if this option is viable as it suits my interest in sports as well as stats. As of right now I would consider this my first option as it was my first idea upon hearing about the capstone project and as a chronically curious person, I am interested in the results.

## 2) NFL Regular Season's Win Percentage Correlated to Percentage of Salary Cap by Player Position

So, in the NFL there is an ever-increasing number that each team can spend on players each season to keep one team from buying all the best players and keep things competitive. This figure increases annually and is known as the "Salary Cap". My idea was to analyze how much of the Salary Cap each team spends per position, per year and to compare that data to the team's regular season win percentage. I think this analysis could help locate potential advantages by identifying historically undervalued positions and that teams would be interested in finding these advantages.

Limitations I foresee with this option would be compiling the data together, but I do believe I should be able to handle it and all the data for this option does appear to be readily available. I would say this is a solid backup plan in case I am not able to make option 1 work.

## 3) College vs Job Prep Programs (ie Flatiron, Trade schools)

For my third idea, I was considering comparing the costs involved with the attending college (money, time, etc.) with the average career earnings or projected date of feasible retirement date and comparing those results to that of a program such as Flatiron or trade schools. 

Things I need to consider for this idea include...

• Should I separate by major?

• Should I only compare like majors? For instance, CS major vs Flatiron CS grad.

• Will I be able to find this data from reliable sources?

• Will Flatiron provide me with some of their data?


This option seems to have the most question marks so I would say I am least likely to choose it, but would still be very interested in the findings if I could pull it off.

## Conclusion

In conclusion I feel as though I have some solid ideas for my Capstone project that require further exploration. I listed the options in the order that I am interested in, but do feel as though I may end up doing option 2 as overcoming the shot order issue from option 1 may prove insurmountable without access to better data sets and the data needed for option 2 does appear to be readily available. Either way I am excited to put the skills I've learned so far to use and be able to apply that knowledge to help solve real world problems!
