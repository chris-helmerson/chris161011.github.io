# Chris Helmerson's Blog Phase 2 (scikit-learn)


# Why "scikit-learn"?

I chose scikit-learn as the topic for my Phase 2 Blog due to the utility it provides and because it will be heavily featured in our Phase 2 Project so I figured it would be wise to get a head start?

# What is "scikit-learn"?

"scikit-learn" is a Python library that is mostly built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib that was created by David Cournapeau as an open source project at Google Summer of Code project in 2007. Today, scikit-learn is largely considered one of the most powerful libraries in Python and is near essential for machine learning in Python. Heavy hitters such as JP Morgan and Spotify both utilize SK-learn for making business decisions. 

# "scikit-learn" Functions

scikit-learn's functionalities include, but are not limited to classification, regression, clustering, etc... What does that mean and why does it matter? Those functionalities are used to identify patterns in datasets and in turn, make predictions. You may not know it, but these concepts are used to shape the world around us everyday. The models created in SK-learn are used to make decisions about what advertisements we see, what movies get made and what kind of healthcare we are provided. 

# Examples
## 1) Classification
Classification, for Data Science purposes, is the sorting of data into categories. A few of the algorithms used by scikit-learn to accomplish classification are Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Discriminant Analysis. "scikit-learn" utilizes these algorithms with machine learning to clean data in the most efficient way I have seen to date. One of the more interesting real world applications I have seen that used this, was converting handwritten numbers into data that could then be quickly used to make decisions. I am excited to see what kinds of classification solutions I am able to come up with over the next few weeks.

## 2) Regression
Regression is used to help describe the impact 1 or more variable have on one another. How can scikit-learn use regression to impact in the real world? Lets say a politician wants to know how to best use a finite amount of tax dollars to help solve a childhood obesity epidemic that impacts their community... It would behoof the politician to ask a well trained Data Scientist to run regression models on various categorical variables to help determine the most effective plan of action, given the constraints. So naturally in this situation, I would expect the politician to go over the findings and instead award the bulk of the funding to their stepbrother's non-profit instead, but I will have to perform further Bayes Theorem testing to confirm. I digress.

## 3) Clustering
Clustering, similar to classification, is the practice of grouping sets of objects into "clusters" based on parameters set by the scikit-learn user. How can clustering be used to address (or sometimes create) real world problems? Some real world problems that clustering can help solve are identifying/classifying new species, medical imaging and market research. One of the more controversial, but likely inevitable, uses of clustering is facial recognition. I am interested to see the dynamics between what we CAN and should do, as a society and what we SHOULD do as a society play out and in turn, clustering/scikit-learn's role in those exchanges.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, scikit-learn is a very powerful tool that impacts our day to day life, even though we likely don't realize it. It's power and applications are only likely to grow as time goes on so I will definitely be paying attention over the next few weeks!
