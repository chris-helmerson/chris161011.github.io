## Chris Helmerson's Blog Phase 2
# scikit-learn 

I chose scikit-learn as the topic for my Phase 2 Blog due to the utility it provides and because it will be heavily featured in our Phase 2 Project so I figured it would be wise to get a head start?

## What is "scikit-learn"?

"scikit-learn" is a Python library that is mostly built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib that was created by David Cournapeau as an open source project at Google Summer of Code project in 2007. Today, scikit-learn is largely considered one of the most powerful libraries in Python and is near essential for machine learning in Python. Heavy hitters such as JP Morgan and Spotify both utilize SK-learn for making business decisions. 

## scikit-learn Functions

scikit-learn's functionalities include, but are not limited to classification, regression, clustering, etc... What does that mean and why does it matter? Those functionalities are used to identify paterns in datasets and in turn, make predictions. You may not know it, but these concepts are used to shape the world around us everyday. The models created in SK-learn are used to make decisions about what advertisements we see, what movies get made and what kind of healthcare we are provided. 

## Thanks For Stopping By

Can't wait to get to know you all better and wish you the best of luck!
