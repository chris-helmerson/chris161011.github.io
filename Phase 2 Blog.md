## Chris Helmerson's Blog Phase 1

Hello,

My name is Chris Helmerson and I am creating this blog as part of my education with Flatiron School. I graduated from Central Washington University with a BS in Accounting and have spent the last 10 years working as an accountant in the construction industry. As an accountant I managed and created financials for several 100M+ investments.

## Why I Chose Data Science.

I chose to switch from a career in Accounting to Data Science for a multitude of reasons, but I would say that the main reason is I have a natural curiosity for finding solutions with mathematical reasoning and Data Science empowers me to do just that. I also will enjoy the better work/life balance as my wife and I recently welcomed our first child, Olive.

## What I Hope to Get Out of Flatiron

I will walk out of Flatiron armed with the tools i need to...

* Provide statistical analysis using imperfect sets of data.
* Write code using Python, SQL, Git, etc
* Succeed in an interview setting and be ready to prove my value.
* Be ready to perform in a team based atmosphere.

I hope to use these skills to land a career in Data Science that enables me to comfortably provide for my family. I would prefer it be related to sports, tech or government, but at this point i'm just looking for a foot in the door.

## Thanks For Stopping By

Can't wait to get to know you all better and wish you the best of luck!
